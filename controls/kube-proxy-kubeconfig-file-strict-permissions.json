    "long_description": "The `kube-proxy` kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the `kube-proxy` service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.\nIt is possible to run `kube-proxy` with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file. In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file.",
    "remediation": "Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example\n```\nchmod 644 <proxy kubeconfig file>\n```\n",
